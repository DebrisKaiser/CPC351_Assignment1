Digital analytics
Digital analytics is a set of business and technical activities that define, create, collect, verify or transform digital data into reporting, research, analyses, recommendations, optimizations, predictions, and automation.[29] This also includes the SEO (search engine optimization) where the keyword search is tracked and that data is used for marketing purposes.[30] Even banner ads and clicks come under digital analytics.[31] A growing number of brands and marketing firms rely on digital analytics for their digital marketing assignments, where MROI (Marketing Return on Investment) is an important key performance indicator (KPI).[citation needed]
