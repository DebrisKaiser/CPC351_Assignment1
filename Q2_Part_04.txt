People analytics
People analytics uses behavioral data to understand how people work and change how companies are managed.[14]

People analytics is also known as workforce analytics, HR analytics, talent analytics, people insights, talent insights, colleague insights, human capital analytics, and HRIS analytics. HR analytics is the application of analytics to help companies manage human resources.[15] Additionally, HR analytics has become a strategic tool in analyzing and forecasting Human related trends in the changing labor markets, using Career Analytics tools.[16] The aim is to discern which employees to hire, which to reward or promote, what responsibilities to assign, and similar human resource problems.[17] For example, inspection of the strategic phenomenon of employee turnover utilizing People Analytics Tools may serve as an important analysis at times of disruption. [18] It has been suggested that People Analytics is a separate discipline to HR analytics, representing a greater focus on business issues rather than administrative processes,[19] and that People Analytics may not really belong within Human Resources in organizations.[20] However, experts disagree on this, with many arguing that Human Resources will need to develop People Analytics as a key part of a more capable and strategic business function in the changing world of work brought on by automation.[21] Instead of moving People Analytics outside HR, some experts argue that it belongs in HR, albeit enabled by a new breed of HR professional who is more data-driven and business savvy.[22]
